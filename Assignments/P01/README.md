### Rykir Evans
### Description:
#### This program explores overloading operators to be able to simply do arithmetic with fractions from the command line as well as an input file

### Files:
|  #  | File                                             | File Description                                     |
| :-: | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | [main.cpp](./Assignments/P01/main.cpp)           |  Main file which reads in from command line.         |
|  2  | [Fraction.cpp](./Assignments/P01/fraction.cpp)   |  Class file for operator overloads and other func.   |
|  3  | [Fraction.h](./Assignments/P01/fraction.h)       |  Header file for fraction class                      |
|  4  | [data.txt](./Assignments/P01/data.txt)           |  Data file to list several fractions                 |

### Instructions:
Call `./main` and either input fractions directly into terminal or input fractions into `data.txt` using x/y + j/k format and reference the file using  `./main < data.txt` 
The correct answer will be displayed to the console
